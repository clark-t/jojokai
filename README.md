Monokai colorscheme for Vim, lightline.vim, buftabline

Inspired by [sickill/vim-monokai](https://github.com/sickill/vim-monokai) and [crusoexia/vim-monokai](https://github.com/crusoexia/vim-monokai), their jobs are exellent!

I noticed their colorschemes use some bright colors, and blingbling my doggy eyes after long time coding, so I copy them to change some colors.

the source is written by nodejs code, and generate to vimscript, it has no function calling on it, which might a little speed up vim opening (?no testing yet...)

and I use the same color to generate a lightline.vim colorscheme and a buftabline colorscheme to make them cooperate better in vision.

That's all.

kono dio da!
